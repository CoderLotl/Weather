*   - When the season is hotter, the air is not cold enough for clouds to form due to the fact they need to condensate. Therefore, it rains less.
*       The oppossite happens when the season is colder. Colder season = more clouds = more rain.
*   - If the air is hotter, the water will evaporate faster and create higher lower humidity.
*
*   - Clouds should go from 0 to 10. Humidity at or above 60 would increase 1. Humidity at or above 80 would increase 2.
*       Humidity at or below 40 would decrease 1. Humidity at or below 20 would decrease 2.
*   - Clouds between 0 and 2 would make it Clear. Between 2 and 4 Some Clouds, 4 and 6 Fairly Clouded, 6 and 8 Clouded, 8 and 10 Heavily Clouded.
*   - During the day humidity is lower than during night.
*   - Dew?...

- The hotter the air, the faster water evaporates but the harder it's for water vapor to condensate, so more air humidity but less clouds.
    So a hotter season makes clouds need a higher humidity to form.
- The colder the air, the less evaporation and the less humidity you get, but the easier it is for water vapor to condensate, therefore less humidity is
    needed for clouds to form and it's easier to get rain when it's colder.
- If the air gets too cold, too, humidity condensates before even forming clouds and falls to the ground. So rains increase the immediate humidity, but 
    in the long term help to reduce it since the air cools with the rain.
- Also the more dry the air is, the more the water droplets evaporate before reaching the ground. The opposite happens when the air is moister. 
So if the season is cold, it's probable that you may get more clouds and more rain than in a hot season, but cloudy days are less prone to produce rain when it's cold than when it's hot.

SEASON: it could be just a number that drifts from -10 to 10, instead of a rough change. NOTE: it actually drifts from -42 to 42. (!!!)
tentative:
humidity for cloud formation:
- hot season: 70%.
-- 60 for slow.
-- humidity increases really fast.
-- humidity decreases really slow.
-- increased chance of rain when it's cloudy (which is rarer than in cold season). This is due to higher humidity.
** reduced chance of rain overall due to requiring high humidity for raining in order to compensate with the hot weather. (not a mechanic, just an observation)
    If the place has a lot of water, rains would be common. Otherwise, the hot seasons could experiment few rains.
    If the place is too dry it could be hellish in hot seasons.
==============================================================
- cold season: 30%.
-- 20 for slow.
-- humidity increases really slow.
-- humidity decreases really fast.
-- reduced chance of rain when it's cloudy (which is more common than in hot season). This is due to lower humidity.
** increased chance of rain overall due to requiring cold weather for raining in order to compensate with the low humidity. (not a mechanic, just an observation)
    If the place has a lot of water, cold seasons could be a hell of rains. Otherwise it would be fine.
    If the place is too dry it could experiment... Snow?...

+++ rain always reduces temperature.
+++ rain always increases humidity.

0. - Now the weather starts as clear, the temperature as an average point for a season = 0, the same with humidity (except you want some specific value).
     The local water starts at whatever you want.

1. - Based on that, the new temperature is set depending on the previous weather and season, and location type.

2. - The new weather is set based on the humidity and clouds and new temperature.

3. - The new humidity is based on the new temperature and weather.

4. - The new local water is based on the change of humidity and weather (if the humidity goes down because of condensation, you get more local water.

5. - If it goes up because of evaporation, you get less local water. - If you get less clouds because of precipitation, you have more water.)
